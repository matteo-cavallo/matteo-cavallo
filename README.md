Developing skill through doing, guiltlessly exploring passion and interests, imbuing quality. Mindful that _everything around me is someone’s life work_.

Indulging in mellow, serene jazz tunes: tracks that establish their rhythm within the initial moments and sustain it throughout the next ten minutes. [Tutu](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8E9TytigkU3f?si=9d6b6caecb2a4965) is a curation of my favorites.
